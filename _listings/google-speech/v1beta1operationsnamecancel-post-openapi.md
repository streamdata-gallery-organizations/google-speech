  title: Google Cloud Speech API Cancel Operation
  description: |-
    Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation.  The server
    makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
    guaranteed.  If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
    `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`.  Clients can use
    Operations.GetOperation or
    other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the
    operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation,
    the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with
    an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1,
    corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
